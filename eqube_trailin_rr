TM :
-
Map contains:
source & dest
attributes
mappings
relations or joins
attribute transformations
predicate, filter using variables

===============

Relations in map :

Primary node and secondary node.


Types of Relation:
- Explicit Relation : based on attribute condition

Predefined Relation: 
  - predefined relations between two business objects.
  - 
  
 Union relations 
  - merge the records of the two nodes into asingle set.
 
subtract Relation:
  - subtract child records from the parent records.
  
User defined relations:
 - customize the relationship between two entities
 

===========================

Map : Node types :

- Default 
- Implicit 
- dependent

Default : indicates a primary object
           Example : Partmaster, documentmaster in plm

Implicit :
